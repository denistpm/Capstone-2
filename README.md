# Capstone-2
Capstone 2

This is the second project for my Data Science course.
In this project, I analyzed a dataset on Airbnb listings in Bangkok for a given period. The goal of this project is to help the company develop strategies based on the available data.

This project consists of several tasks:
1. Data Overview
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Analysis
4. Summary
5. Strategies

This project is far from perfect, so comments and suggestions are highly appreciated.
Thank you.
